# cesm_toolbox

This is a collection of utilitiy classes and functions for easily manipulating, 
plotting, and examining CESM output. This is primarily my (Jeremy's) personal
repository for exploring paleoclimate simulations. 

This code is provided *as is*. You are more than welcome to use it for your own 
purposes, request features, submit bugs/pull requests, but there is no guarantee
that I will respond or incorporate changes. However, I will do my best to respond
and help out if requested.

## Development

All code is formatted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). Please ensure 
code follows those style guidelines before making changes. 

There are, currently, no tests, but I if this toolbox becomes more involved I would
like to add them.
